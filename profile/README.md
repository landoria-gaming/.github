## Valheim Docker image

The [Valheim Docker image](https://github.com/landoria-gaming/valheim-server-image/pkgs/container/valheim_server.x86_64) includes the dedicated server and BepInExPack_Valheim. Updates are checked daily, and the image is rebuilt when a new version of Valheim or BepInExPack_Valheim is available.

This means the image normally contains the latest Valheim dedicated server version once the daily update check and build have completed.

## Harmony Validator

When patching a public method, you can use C#'s `nameof` to let the compiler check its name. Private methods sometimes need to be targeted by a string, which the compiler cannot check.

[Harmony Validator](https://github.com/landoria-gaming/HarmonyValidator) verifies during the build that the targeted method exists and that the patch parameters match. This makes mods more robust by catching missing methods or incompatible parameter changes at compile time.

Harmony Validator is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HarmonyValidator), so you can add it directly to your mod project. All Landoria mods use this validator.
